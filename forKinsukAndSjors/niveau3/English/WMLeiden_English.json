        "content": "### History of the museum\n\nThe history of today\u2019s Wereldmuseum Leiden goes back to 1837. Its first hundred years were characterised by financial difficulties, the accumulation of large quantities of objects and many changes of location. In 1937 the museum finally found a permanent home in the former University Hospital where it could display its entire collection. The museum is still located in this building. \n\nThe collection of the Wereldmuseum Leiden originated from the private collection of [Philipp Franz von Siebold](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q77140), who was also the museum's first director. His collection, which originally consisted mainly of Japanese objects, was expanded during the 19th century to include several private collections and, in 1883, a significant collection of ethnographic objects from the collection of the [Royal Cabinet of Curiosities](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/en/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2Fcc7609accb9857dc8ca777ff1d6d4af1). At the start of the twentieth century, part of the collection of the [Museum of Antiquities](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/en/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2F732277d365ab6fbcc351da7bc2b900b3) in Leiden was also transferred to what was then the Rijks Ethnographisch Museum (National Museum of Ethnology). The latter group of objects included the various Singhasari statues, some of which were returned to Indonesia in 1978 and others in 2023. Objects were also transferred from the National Museum of Ethnology to other museums, such as the Anatomical Museum in Leiden in 1935. \n\nObjects were acquired in various ways. First, as described above, through exchange with other museums. In addition, the National Museum of Ethnology itself was an active buyer of ethnographic objects from dealers and auctions, with for example part of the museum's collection of Benin Bronzes having been obtained in this way. Many objects were also received as donations, often from [colonial civil servants](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/en/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2F4f29663e147ee9c1ee7a9eb3019fca18) or [military personnel](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/en/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2F0ceff3da7d6bba371bb16767a65b619e) who served for example with the Royal Dutch East Indies Army (KNIL). The vast majority of the collection of the present Wereldmuseum Leiden was therefore collected during the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n![Picture of the Wereldmuseum Leiden in November 2024](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Wereldmuseum_Leiden_%28nov_2024%29.jpg)\n_The Wereldmuseum Leiden in November 2024 ([Sneeuwvlakte / Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wereldmuseum_Leiden_(nov_2024).jpg#))_\n\n### Provenance research\n\nObjects from the Wereldmuseum Leiden can be identified within the Wereldmuseum collection by the attribute \u2018RV-\u2019. \u2018RV-360\u2019 comprises the objects that were received from the [Royal Cabinet of Curiosities](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/en/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2Fcc7609accb9857dc8ca777ff1d6d4af1) in 1883. \u2018RV-1403\u2019 refers to a significant collection of objects that were transferred from the [Museum of Antiquities](https://app.colonialcollections.nl/en/research-aids/https%3A%2F%2Fn2t%252Enet%2Fark%3A%2F27023%2F732277d365ab6fbcc351da7bc2b900b3) in 1904. The Wereldmuseum Leiden has kept records of the collection since its foundation. However, the archive system has changed several times and different documentation is available for each object or collection series (several pieces that were registered at the same time). \n\nThe archives can roughly be divided into the collection archive and the correspondence archive. The collection archive consists of object registers, inventories, series files and, for some older objects, lists of donations and exchanges. This archive can be found under NL-LdnRMV_A3. The correspondence archive contains incoming letters and telegrams, copies of outgoing letters, lists of incoming and outgoing correspondence, and so on. This archive can be found under NL-LdnRMV_A1.\n\nThe archive of the Wereldmuseum Leiden is not accessible online. For more information about the collection or to view archival documents please contact [collectieinfo@wereldmuseum.nl](mailto:collectieinfo@wereldmuseum.nl). \n\nDocuments related to the Wereldmuseum Leiden can also be found at the Dutch National Archives, these are mainly administrative records. The archives of museums that exchanged collections with Wereldmuseum Leiden may contain further archival material on those specific objects.\n",
